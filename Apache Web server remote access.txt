This document assumes you have completed the Remote and Wifi setups, detailed in other documents

1. Connect your raspberry pi to the internet. I would recommend connecting the pi to the internet using an ethernet cable
and then remoting into the pi using vnc viewer and the wifi setup.

2. 
Open the command prompt and run the line below to install apache to the pi
sudo apt-get install apache2

3. Open a web browser and go on http://localhost/ on the pi itself or http://192.168.0.102 (the pi's IP address)
on another computer on the same network you should see the "Apache2 Debian Default Page"

4. The default web page is an HTML file, located at /var/www/html/index.html run the command lines
below to navigate to the file and change the owner so you can edit it
cd /var/www/html
sudo chown pi: index.html

Now you can go to the index.html in the specified location and edit it to change the file
