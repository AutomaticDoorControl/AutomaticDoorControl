A guide to ngrok: IP tunneling
Note, this should work on any device that can run command line arguments, so 
it would work on the raspberry pi, but not on the Arduino. We'd probably use this for the
demo if we can't get bluetooth or something else to work.

1. go to https://ngrok.com/ and create a free account
2. Download ngrok (and unzip after the installion)
3. The site instructions talk about verifying your account, but I never bothered to do this and 
ngrok still worked fine
4. Run our app (follow instructions documented AutoDoorCtrlWeb and AutoDoorCtrlWebAPI on github)
5. Navigate to the ngrok directory (should be ngrok-stable-   followed by your OS) and type
ngrok.exe http 4200 (or 8080 if your hosting the API).
6. A popup on the command line will say forwarding: followed by an ip address followed by localhost:4200
(or localhost:8080) ex: http://a9e8f7ad.ngrok.io -> localhost:4200. You can access the app from the IP on any device (even those
that aren't on the same network).
