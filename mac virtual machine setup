NOTE: this requires a lot of free disk space (around 126G)
1. Download virtualbox (if you haven't already) at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. Make sure you have Mas OS Sierra (you can get this at the mac online store). You will need a
valid identification key
3. Go into the Mac OS and grab the InstallESD.dmg file (move it to it's own folder)
4. Convert the Mac OS from a .dmg file to a .iso file, to make the disk for the machine
	Go to https://www.howtogeek.com/102983/how-to-convert-dmg-files-to-iso-files-on-windows/ and follow the instructions
5. Now, we can actually create the VM: open virtual box and click new
6. In the popup window, select type: Mac OS X   selection version to be whatever version of MAC OS you are using (have the .iso for)
In this example, set the name to MacOS (can be anything)
7. Set the memory size to 4096 MB
8. Create a virutal hard disk now
9. Chose a VDI for the hard disk file type
10. Choose dynamically sized for the size type
11. Set the file location to wherever you prefer, set the file size to 126GB
12. Create the machine
13. Go into machine settings:
	Under system, uncheck floppy in the boot order block (should be optical and hard drive
	In the processor tab, set Processor(s) to the line betweeen green and red
	Under display, set video memory to its maximum value
	Under storage: delete the empty disk, create a new SATA controller. In that controller, add a new optical drive. Choose the InstallESD.iso file
14. Open command line and type the following commands (note that "MacOS" should be the name of your vm and "deviceKey" should be your device key)
cd "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\"
VBoxManage.exe modifyvm "MacOS" --cpuidset 00000001 000106e5 00100800 0098e3fd bfebfbff
VBoxManage setextradata "MacOS" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiSystemProduct" "iMac11,3"
VBoxManage setextradata "MacOS" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiSystemVersion" "1.0"
VBoxManage setextradata "MacOS" "VBoxInternal/Devices/efi/0/Config/DmiBoardProduct" "Iloveapple"
VBoxManage setextradata "MacOS" "VBoxInternal/Devices/smc/0/Config/DeviceKey" "deviceKey"
VBoxManage setextradata "MacOS" "VBoxInternal/Devices/smc/0/Config/GetKeyFromRealSMC" 1
15. Start the VM, you'll seee some command line jargin, the machine will then restart, ask for a default language, and download iso.
