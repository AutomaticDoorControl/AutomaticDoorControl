Note: This is assuming you have run the RasberryRemoteConfiguration
Router information:
Current router name is AutomaticDoor on channel 6. Username is admin, password is password
1. Load up the Rasberry pi remote connection.
2. open the terminal and type sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	This will allow for the editting of the wpa_supplicant.conf file
   edit the file to read

   ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
   network={
   ssid="AutomaticDoor"
   key_mgmt=NONE
   }

   After you finish, use ctrl+x to save the file

3. Type ifconfig wlan0  to the terminal
    Look for the inet addr field and verify it is the ISP of the network

4. Type wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure to the terminal to configure wlan0
    output should be OK, if not, try running the following commands
    sudo ifup wlan0   
    sudo ifdown wlan0
    sudo ifup wlan0
    wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure     

5. Type sudo ifup wlan0 to the terminal
   You should now be connected to the network can see this on top right under wifi

6. Run the following command in the terminal to create a vncserver
	vncserver :1
*note the 1 is the VNCserver, this can be any number
*note If you every shut off the raspberry pi, you will have to restart the VNC server (nothing else has to be repeated)

7. Install VNCViewer on your android phone on the play store

8. Swtich your android phone to the same network as wlan0 is on (should be AutomaticDoor)

9. Launch VNCViewer from your android phone and create a new connection
	Address should be in the form IPAddress:vncserver
		you can get the IPAddress from mousing over the wifi on the raspberry pi, look for the IPAddress
		on the same line as "wlan0 Configured" 
		*NOTE: if the IPAddress contains a '/' ignore the '/' and everything after it
		vncserver is the same as in step 6
	Name can []       be whatever the user prefers, I'd recommend Pi

10. Use VNCViewer to connect from your phone to the Raspberry Pi, you will get a warning, ignore it
	the username is pi
	the password is raspberry
11. You Can now connect to the raspberry pi to any device using AutomaticDoor wirelessly (:
12. If you want to try the demo app on your phone, use VNCViewer to connect, open the command prompt and type
 	CD Documents
	python3 popuptest.py
